 *
 * TreeDrawer is used to give a visual representation of the tree structure of the
 * Zeckendorf game described in (Epstein 2018). It plays through a specified game,
 * determining all moves that can be made, and draw all possible paths to the end of
 * this game. 
 *
 * Each horizontal layer is composed of GameStates that can be reached in the same 
 * number of moves, namely the depth of the layer (e.g. any state in the 3rd layer
 * is reached in exactly 3 moves). States with red trim are states at which player 2
 * has a winning strategy over player 1, and states with blue trim are those at which
 * player 1 has a winning startegy. Lines between states signify that the lower state
 * can be reached after a single move from the upper state (parent/child relationship
 * in the tree structure).
 *
 * States highlighted in yellow are terminal. There can be at most 1 of these in any
 * layer by design. Experiments to this point have shown that player 2 always has a 
 * winning strategy (true up to 50), therefore we highlight states in green if they 
 * belong to "the" winning path for player 2 (in reality, there are several winning 
 * paths but we highlight just a single one).
 *
 * The TreeDrawer can be executed, after compilaton, by running the command
 *
 *          appletviewer TreeDrawer.java
 *
 * Do not delete the comment in the preamble, as this is used at runtime by the
 * appletviewer.
